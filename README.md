Based on the provided code snippets, I'll describe the current project:

# Swiggy Agent Project

This is a Python-based project that implements a Swiggy delivery agent using the Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) framework. Here are the key components:

## Project Structure
- Main agent implementation in <mcfile name="agent.py" path="/Users/tamilselavans/Downloads/adk_agent/testagent/agent.py"></mcfile>
- Uses Python 3.11 (specified in <mcfile name=".python-version" path="/Users/tamilselavans/Downloads/adk_agent/.python-version"></mcfile>)

## Core Features
1. **Food Order Management**: The <mcsymbol name="FoodDataHandler" filename="agent.py" path="/Users/tamilselavans/Downloads/adk_agent/testagent/agent.py" startline="6" type="class"></mcsymbol> class handles food-related data operations
2. **Menu Information**: Manages food data including:
   - Food names
   - Types
   - Prices
   - Offers
   - Restaurant information

## Technical Stack
- **AI Model**: Uses LiteLLM with the Ollama/llama3:8b model
- **Dependencies**:
  - google-adk
  - litellm
  - pandas
  - Other supporting libraries

## Project Configuration
- Uses `pyproject.toml` for project configuration
- Includes proper `.gitignore` for Python projects
- Follows modern Python packaging standards

## Purpose
The agent is designed to:
- Help with food orders
- Track deliveries
- Provide restaurant recommendations
- Handle menu queries
- Process customer interactions

This appears to be a sophisticated implementation of a food delivery assistant that leverages AI capabilities to provide a more intelligent ordering experience.
